Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

This project is part of my first Module with Code Academy Berlin. The purpose of the project is to become comfortable with using HTML and CSS. The project specs were to create a 4 page website: a homepage, a special page, a registration page, and a contact page. I needed to incorporate images and text, a list, a table, a form with input elements, an imbedded map, an email program launch function, and navigation between pages. We were expected to include both grid and flexbox in our layout, which I was able to combine with mediaquery to create basic responsive results.
